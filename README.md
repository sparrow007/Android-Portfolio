# BeatPlayer Music Application

This is my first application when I was learning android application development, most of the things I implement in the application is custom means I almost try not to use 3rd party libraries because I wanted to learn more deeply about low-level APIs of android.


The application will show you the all the songs which are available in your phone using the content provider and at the same time, it will create the service for the application so that you can easily play the music in the background and I use foreground service with a notification which means you can also listen to your music even if you remove the application from the background. The application also offers you the albums where you have songs according to their albums so you can listen to music based on the albums, also you can search for music in application. It also offers you a good user interface with animation so you will stick to use the application.

# Stry Application (Educational Application)

This application is still in development and I was on the contract-based android application where I make quizzes, statistics, overlay windows, and fix some errors in different sections of the app.

Application is for the students which contain questions in a quiz wrapped in a package, also the teacher can create packages with number of questions in its answer and those packages will get converted in the quiz and these packages will be available in the packaging market in the application. There are other useful features in application like a floating window where the user can enable and give answers while he is outside of the application and other features like sharing packages and give a review to packages.

# Storyfy Application

When I was working in a company as an intern, I build this application which is basically a storytelling application where you story coming from the server and you can choose your choice in order turn story in your direction.

The application uses firebase to store stories and also it shows different twists according to user choice. It has a quite simple user interface with some animation, the application will upload new stories as they completing writing the stories by writer and the user does not need to update the application in order to read new content. I have used a custom user interface because requirements are to make the app more like a book so we have made the custom drawable and view to perform this action.

# Covid Tracker

I build this application when I was doing a challenge at topcoder where i have APIs for the covid-19 data so this application used to track cases all over the world.
The application uses retrofit, data binding, and Rx java for calling API and fetch all the data in order to show on the list. I used graphs also for indicating the number of cases, deaths, and confirmed cases all over the world. You can also see data particular to a country.

## Some Cool Projects :smile:

### Computer controller

Application is used to control keyboard and mouse in the computer using an android phone, you need to install server application in computer and apk in android, in order to work the application your both devices should be in the same network. You can even play games using a gyro sensor in android.

### Computer vision controller
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/check-it-out.svg)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SbcrwfzXhUZwYGfqmsB1J5maa8Ju0ww9) 

You can use a single paper to control the game, you just need to show paper in front of camera and move to different directions in order to control the game.
This application is using the OpenCV for performing computer vision algorithms it is used to capture the color and also calculate a distance where the paper is moved and then converting coordinate into a game coordinate and press the buttons for controlling the game.
